![Icon](icon.png) Close Tab
===========================

This is an Add-on for Firefox for Android.

If enabled, a PageAction will be added to close the tab.
This PageAction is persistent over all tabs.
As long as there are open tabs, you'll be able to close them just by pressing
the little Ã—-Button at the end of the Address Bar.
